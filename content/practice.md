        Together we will co-create each session and the best way therapy will work for you. As a therapist, I facilitate the therapeutic process when in the room together; however, I hold you as the expert of your own life, and my intention is to guide you to the answers that best fit your life, world view and values.I am a strength-based and solution-focused therapist.
      </p>

      <p>
        When challenges seem insurmountable or unchangeable, I steer the conversations to solutions and the inherent strengths within yourself or your relationships to foster change and steps toward resolution. Empowering you with the skills and insight to better understand and resolve your issues is an important part of our work together.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Knowledge about the physiology of your body and the root of your symptoms, skills for emotional regulation, relationship tools and positive communication skills or parenting strategies are just a few of the topics that we may explore.

          Paying out of pocket for therapy rather than using insurance benefits can be advantageous for several reasons:
        </h4>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In order to bill insurance, I must give you a mental health diagnosis after the first session. If your symptoms do not fit the severity of a mental health diagnosis, I must give you one anyway. For youth seeking military service in adulthood, this could pose a barrier to enlisting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insurance determines the length of each session (45-50 minutes) and how many sessions we can meet. Each person is unique and requires a tailored treatment plan and insurance makes that more challenging.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many insurance plans only allow face to face sessions usually one time per week. I often provide teletherapy via the phone or videoconferencing when clients are unable to come into my office for any reason. Stressors or crisisâ€™ do not always happen on a preset time table and having the flexibility to schedule sessions when, how often and from where you want is important.

          How long is each session?
        </h4>
        <p>
          We decide together. It depends on the intensity of symptoms or issues you are seeking to resolve. I can provide brief, solution-focused treatment to address moderate issues in 6-10 sessions. These sessions are usually focused on skill building and problem solving of present issues. We can also delve into deeper emotional or relational issues that may need longer term therapy to adequately address. We will decide together when you have reached your goals and when it is a good time to end treatment.

          How often do we meet?
        </h4>
        <p>
          We decide together. Initially, it is beneficial to meet on a weekly basis in order to facilitate movement toward your goals. As progress is made, biweekly sessions or meeting every 3 weeks may be a better fit for you. If finances are a barrier, we can determine together how often you are able to come in.

          How many sessions do I need?
        </h4>
        <p>
          A standard session length is 50 minutes.  Extended sessions for couples work, and other needs are available depending on the intensity of treatment desired.  For couples and families, I recommend 1-1.5 hour sessions in order to most effectively address the needs of each participant.

          Do you provide therapy online?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Yes. I provide video therapy through an online, secure video conferencing platform in which I can bring my office to you. Video therapy can be beneficial for those who cannot find a therapist in their area with my specialties or for current clients who are traveling in Nebraska and cannot meet face-to-face for a few sessions. Additionally, clients who are home-bound for a period of time due to health issues, may choose to have sessions online. I do not hold sessions online for clients seeking insurance reimbursement. <strong>Only fee for service sessions apply.</strong>
