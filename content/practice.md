        Together we will co-create each session and the best way therapy will work for you. As a therapist, I facilitate the therapeutic process when in the room together; however, I hold you as the expert of your own life, and my intention is to guide you to the answers that best fit your life, world view and values.I am a strength-based and solution-focused therapist.

        When challenges seem insurmountable or unchangeable, I steer the conversations to solutions and the inherent strengths within yourself or your relationships to foster change and steps toward resolution. Empowering you with the skills and insight to better understand and resolve your issues is an important part of our work together.

        Knowledge about the physiology of your body and the root of your symptoms, skills for emotional regulation, relationship tools and positive communication skills or parenting strategies are just a few of the topics that we may explore.
