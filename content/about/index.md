Am I the right therapist for you? I would say that finding the right therapist is based on the “goodness of fit model”- whether my approach to therapy and personality are the right fit for you. So let me share a little more about myself, so you can decide if we would work well together.

Most clients describe me as authentic, friendly, nonjudgmental and down-to-earth. I enjoy what I do and find the conversations with my clients stimulating and exciting. You will always get an honest feedback from me. One of my personal values is to practice what I preach. I will not ask you to engage in treatment modalities I have not practiced myself. Health and well-being is the backbone of my personal life practice and is an ongoing pursuit of my growth and learning. The exploration of the mind-body connection and various healing modalities within both my personal and professional life have provided me with an in-depth understanding of the interplay between physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health and happiness.
