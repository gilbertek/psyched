              Military Service members, Retired Veterans and their families
            </h3>
            <p>
              Active military service can often lead to physical, emotional and mental stress for both military service members and their loved ones. Common problems that can arise for military personnel may include PTSD, combat trauma, grief, guilt, anger, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and relationship conflicts. Families often experience a variety of issues related to deployment(s) and reintegrating home again. I am passionate about providing quality care to soldiers and their families who are currently serving in the military or retired from active duty.
