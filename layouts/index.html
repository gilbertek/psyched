      I work with individuals and families looking to overcome personal challenges, such as marital issues, grief,
      depression, anxiety, anger, family conflict, relationship issues, a major life transition challenges or
      spirituality
      issues. I've spent nearly two decades in ministry-helping kids, teens, adults, parents, groups, and families
      navigate
      their unique situations. I have over 4 years of military service, traveled the world and embrace all peoples,
      cultures, and beliefs. I use a holistic, nonjudgment and multicultural approach to counseling. I am here to
      journey
      with you and to help you achieve your counseling goals if you let me.</p>

        I work with teens and adults struggling with anxiety, anger, grief, depression, family conflict, marital or
        relationship issues, spirituality, self-esteem, suicide ideation and trauma using the solution-focused,
        person-centered or CBT methods. I believe in working with clients' strengths and support systems to enable them to
      meet their goals.

      My approach to counseling is a little different than what you may be used to. I use a holistic approach and will
      explore any issue with you, including spirituality issues. I believe in an in-home model to help you succeed which
      means my office is your home or my office. I will meet you where you are to help you achieve your desired
      counseling
      goals.
